Open source nvida drivers cause critical errors in the system, we are back to closed source drivers
The system will no longer be trixie based by default. I decided to build it based on Bookworm. My goal was to provide stability and solve trixie related problems.

Nvidia Systemd Service Failed - I'm working on this issue and will fix it as soon as possible.

Securonis Linux 1.9.1 

Partially resolved the Nvidia systemd service error.

The system was rebuilt based on trixie. The reason for this is that the dnscrypt-proxy package is not available in bookworm, I am working on the dns encryption feature. Also, the calamares interface is terrible and some of its features were not working.

Minor Bugs: Firmware bug - It doesn't look visually appealing so I'll close this
