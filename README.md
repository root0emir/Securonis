# Securonis Linux - Privacy and Security Focused Debian Based Distribution

# Announcement: Due to the instability of Debian Trixie and the resulting package issues, I am rebuilding Securonis Linux from scratch based on Debian Bookworm (stable).

Securonis is a privacy and security-focused Linux distribution based on Debian Trixie. Securonis works both in live mode, leaving no trace, and also includes the Calamares installer, which helps users install it to a fixed disk. With the **Anonymous Mode** tool, Securonis forces all incoming and outgoing traffic to route through the Tor network. Additionally, this tool minimizes identity leakage risks with several additional features. IPv6 is disabled, the MAC address can be changed, and traffic routing can be started or stopped with a single command.

## Some Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is Securonis Based on Debian Trixie?

The reason Securonis is based on Debian Trixie is to ensure that the applications and the system are up to date, minimizing potential security vulnerabilities. While it could have been based on Debian Stable, Debian Trixie was chosen for its more up-to-date packages, which provide better security.

### How Does Securonis Compare to Other Privacy-Focused Systems?

Securonis offers powerful traffic routing features and includes a tool that prevents identity leakage. Additionally, it provides simple but effective scripts for a password manager, an encrypted note-taking application, system management tools for everyday tasks, and **USBToolkit** to manage your flash drives. It also includes the **Nuke2System** script, which safely wipes the system and leaves no trace in emergency situations. Compared to other privacy and security-focused systems, Securonis is designed specifically for everyday use and does not require complex, rigid configurations. It provides above-average privacy and security for daily use without a doubt.

### Does Securonis Have Repositories?

Securonis Linux does not require a repository. The necessary features and customizations are embedded into the distribution using scripts and tools. Initially, I considered creating a repository but decided against it due to security concerns and the potential difficulties. Instead, I will release new **.iso** versions at regular intervals (every 6 months to a year). These releases will include significant updates and improvements.

### What is the Purpose of the Project? How Many People are Developing It?

The goal of the project is to provide privacy and security for everyday use. With the rise of cybercrime, itâ€™s important to make security and privacy accessible to everyone. Currently, the project is developed by a single person. The project was developed using Debian's **live-build** tool. If you would like to contribute, feel free to get in touch with me.

### How Can I Contribute?

You can contribute to the project by:
- **Forking** the repository and making privacy/security improvements.
- Providing support via **Bitcoin** donations. (Wallet link: [-])
