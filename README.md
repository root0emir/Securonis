# Securonis Linux 

# Announcement: "There is a bug preventing the system from being installed on a hard drive, and this issue is not caused by me. It is related to Calamares or live-build. I am in contact with the developers and will try to resolve this issue as soon as possible."

Securonis is a privacy and security-focused Linux distribution based on Debian. Securonis works both in live mode, leaving no trace, and also includes the Calamares installer, which helps users install it to a fixed disk. With the **Anonymous Mode** tool, Securonis forces all incoming and outgoing traffic to route through the Tor network. Additionally, this tool minimizes identity leakage risks with several additional features. IPv6 is disabled, the MAC address can be changed, and traffic routing can be started or stopped with a single command.


Securonis offers powerful traffic routing features and includes a tool that prevents identity leakage. Additionally, it provides simple but effective scripts for a password manager, an encrypted note-taking application, system management tools for everyday tasks, and **USBToolkit** to manage your flash drives. It also includes the **Nuke2System** script, which safely wipes the system and leaves no trace in emergency situations. Compared to other privacy and security-focused systems, Securonis is designed specifically for everyday use and does not require complex, rigid configurations. It provides above-average privacy and security for daily use without a doubt.

## Conclusion

I wish you safe and secure internet browsing!
