# About

Securonis Linux is a Debian Testing-based Linux distribution focused on privacy and security. Simplicity and minimalism are the core philosophy of Securonis. It comes with a special script that routes all internet traffic through the Tor network. Users can start traffic routing with a single click, encrypt DNS with a single click, and harden the kernel against attacks with a single click. Unlike other systems, mandatory traffic routing is not always enforced; users have the freedom to configure the system as they wish. However, everything is designed to be as simple as possible through automation.

Securonis uses the MATE desktop environment, which provides a fast and lightweight experience. It features Panic Mode, allowing users to manage their system, monitor identity leaks, and check system status in emergency situations. Additionally, Paranoia Mode, located within Panic Mode, completely isolates the system from the outside world and enforces strict security rules.

Furthermore, Securonis includes essential security tools such as a secure note-taking app, password manager, secure browser, and USB security toolkit.

Securonis Linux is fully open source. All tools are developed using Python and Shell to ensure they are as simple and minimal as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity and bloat—I do not like unnecessary complexity and excess.

Why I Created This

My goal was to create a simple, minimal, fast, and secure Linux distribution. In today’s world, there isn’t a Linux distribution that can be installed on a hard drive and provides privacy and security for everyday use. Securonis does exactly that—it provides a secure system for daily use. You won’t be reliant on virtual machines or a flash drive, and you don’t have to use complex systems that constantly route Tor traffic. If you're looking for a secure browser and system experience, you're in the right place. Additionally, Securonis works in Live Mode, meaning you don’t have to install it—you can try it out or use it portably; it’s up to you. Designing Securonis was enjoyable, though quite challenging at times. I hope you enjoy using it!
